    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an Japanese Egg Sandwich, the recipe is taken from <a
            href='https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-egg-sandwich-tamago-sando/'>justonecookbook.com</a>. I
        thought of including this recipe because it was from an anime I liked watching, <em>Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no
            Gohan</em>. I've personally never tried making this dish but I hopefully soon whenever things clear up.</p>
