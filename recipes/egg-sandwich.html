    <img src='../images/egg-sandwich.jpeg' alt='Picture of egg sandwich.'>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an Japanese Egg Sandwich, the recipe is taken from <a
            href='https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-egg-sandwich-tamago-sando/'>justonecookbook.com</a>. I
        thought of including this recipe because it was from an anime I liked watching - <em>Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no
            Gohan</em>. I've personally never tried making this dish but I hopefully soon whenever things clear up. The
        recipe will take around 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs (50g each w/o shell</li>
        <li>4 slices shokupan (Japanese pullman loaf bread)</li>
        <li>Salted butter</li>

            <ul>
                <li>1/4 tsp sugar</li>
