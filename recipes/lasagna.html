    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna taken from <a

        This lasagna seems simplistic enough but delicious and is most likely a weekend night dish. This dish will
        probably take around <strong>1 hour and 15 minutes.</strong></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tsp. extra- virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (32-0z) jars marinara</li>
        <li>16 oz. whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 c. chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 lb. sliced mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cook pasta al dente (according to package directions) in large pot of salted
            boiling water. Drain and drizzle some olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and then pour in some oil. Cook ground beef, breaking up with a
            wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink. Remove from heat and drain fat, then return beef to skillet and
            add garlic and oregano to cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Then add
            marinara and stir until warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper to
            taste (if you're okay with consuming raw egg.)
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of meat across the dish, then repeat these sequence of
            steps until it is filled to the top of the casserole dish:
            <ol>
                <li>Top with a single layer of lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>Top with a single layer of the ricotta mixture</li>
                <li>Top with a single layer of mozzarella</li>
                <li>Top with a layer of meat sauce</li>
            </ol>
            Once you're done, top the last layer with Parmesan and mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400 degrees and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
